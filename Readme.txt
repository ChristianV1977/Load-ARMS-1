Usage
=====

If the game is not running, ExtendWhitelist will start it. If the game is running, the whitelist of the running game will be updated. You will need to reload any running world.

Dedicated Server
================
Unpack to ...\SpaceEngineers\DedicatedServer64, run ExtendWhitelist.exe.
If the dedicated server is not running, ExtendWhitelist will start the configurator. If the configurator is already running, ExtendWhitelist will wait for the server to start. If the dedicated server is running, ExtendWhitelist will modify the whitelist.
