Downloads the latest ARMS scripts and loads them into Space Engineers. The scripts will run only alongside the models, which are distributed via steam.

Usage
=====
Unpack to ...\SpaceEngineers\Bin64, run LoadARMS.exe.
If the game is not running, LoadARMS will start it. If the game is running, ARMS will be loaded into the running game. You will need to reload any running world.

Dedicated Server
================
Unpack to ...\SpaceEngineers\DedicatedServer64, run LoadARMS.exe.
If the dedicated server is not running, LoadARMS will start the configurator. If the configurator is already running, LoadARMS will wait for the server to start. If the dedicated server is running, LoadARMS will load ARMS into the server.
