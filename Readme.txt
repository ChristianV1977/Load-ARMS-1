The new process downloads the latest release of ARMS scripts and injects them into Space Engineers, bypassing the whitelist entirely.

Extend Whitelist will be removed when you run Load-ARMS.

The scripts will run only alongside the models, which are distributed via steam.

The scripts will run despite Space Engineer's error messages. The error messages will be fixed in the future.

Usage
=====
Unpack to ...\SpaceEngineers\Bin64, run LoadARMS.exe.
If the game is not running, LoadARMS will start it. If the game is running, ARMS will be loaded into the running game. You will need to reload any running world.
LoadARMS must be run every time you launch Space Engineers.

Dedicated Server
================
Unpack to ...\SpaceEngineers\DedicatedServer64, run LoadARMS.exe.
If the dedicated server is not running, LoadARMS will start the configurator. If the configurator is already running, LoadARMS will wait for the server to start. If the dedicated server is running, LoadARMS will load ARMS into the server.
LoadARMS must be run every time you launch Space Engineers.
